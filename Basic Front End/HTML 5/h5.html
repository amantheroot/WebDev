					<h3>CHESS FACTS</h3>
					<p> The London international, one of the earliest of tournaments, was a knockout event. Even though many of the stronger participants were eliminated at the start, Anderssen's win was well-deserved. However some irregularities involving Anderssen existed. First, in order to facilitate his participation, Howard Staunton, from his personal funds, promised to reimburse Anderssen's expenses should he fail to win enough to cover them - despite the fact that the Berliners also assisted Anderssen financially; second, Anderssen entered into an agreement with József Szén that, if either one of them won, he would give the other one third of the winnings. Wikipedia claims: "this does not appear to have been considered in any way unethical" but it does seem to have been considered irregular and unbecoming a champion.  Major Carl Jaenisch of Russia wrote: "Why, did not Mr. Anderssen himself, in a moment of trepidation, enter into an arrangement with Mr. Szén, that if either of them was lucky enough to gain the first prize, he should pay to the other one-third of the amount?  Was not this an extraordinary piece of conduct for a " Chess King," if he have seriously accepted the title which ill-judging admirers have decreed him ?"  Jaenisch was writing a response to an editorial penned by Otto von Oppen, editor of the "Deutsche Schachzeitung," in which he (unjustly) attacked Staunton for his words about Anderssen and for depriving him of the proper prize amount.   It's not clear, but it seems the prize money, reduced through the agreement with Szén, also reduced the amount the Berlin subscribers would receive and inspired von Oppen's vitriolic attack. </p>
