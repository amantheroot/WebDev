B - Block
E - Element
M - Modifier

Blocks are standalone elements and their class names must be unique
eg. <div class="head"></div>  || .head  { }

Elements are the children of blocks which have no standalone qualities,
their class names are the block names followed by 2 "underscores" and then
the element name.
eg. <div class="head"><p class="head__para"></p></div> || .head__para { }

Modifiers are the special properties an element or block might have which must
be specified in their class name, their class name is the name of block or
element followed by 2 "dashes" and then the modifier name.
eg. <div class="head--color-blue"></div> || .head--color-blue { color: blue; }

Don't use Id's.
